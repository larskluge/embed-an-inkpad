# embed-an-inkpad

Ruby gem to allow an simple embedding of a rendered Inkpad document within your custom Rails project.


## Why?

Ever experienced you had to build a custom static page into your Rails project and all the information you got provided were in a Word document? Yeah, what a fun task. Better: ever experienced the same person needed this page in the first place made an update somewhere in this xx pages long documentâ€”and you have to find the difference to get it online? Yep, even more fun.

`embed-an-inkpad` allows to embed the rendered content of a document hosted on [Inkpad.io](https://www.inkpad.io) in your Rails project. Simple embedding with one line of code, never be bothered with updates anymore since the requester herself is able to make updates w/o a developer involved anymore.


## Usage

Add dependency in your `Gemfile` & run `bundle`:

    gem 'embed-an-inkpad'

Then use it somewhere in your view files: `app/views/**/*`

    <h1>My Website</h1>
    <%= embed_an_inkpad "lJ2wS79HC" %>

On gem require a Rails view helper named `embed_an_inkpad` is included. The only parameter is an Inkpad id to refer to your document you like to include. In this example, the document [lJ2wS79HC](https://www.inkpad.io/lJ2wS79HC) is included.
